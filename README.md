# Neural Ensemble Analysis
Graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB for analyzing neural ensembles. It is a flexible tool for analyze the population activity from neural circuits recorded by calcium imaging or multi-electrode arrays.

Clone the repository and run the GUI file "Neural_Ensemble_Analysis.m".

1. Load your raster of neuronal activity. 
2. Get the coactivity. 
3. Get the neuronal vectors. 
4. Compute similarity and hierarchical clustering. 
5. Cluster vectors, get the neuronal ensembles. 
6. Get the functional connection neuronal ensembles. 
7. Plot measures.
